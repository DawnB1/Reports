Best Practices


What should a risk profile include?
A risk profile should include:
The nature and level of the threats faced by an organization.
The likelihood of adverse effects occurring.
The level of disruption and costs associated with each type of risk.
The effectiveness of the controls in place to manage those risks.

What is the General Data Protection Regulation & Consumer Privacy Act?
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are laws that emerged to give individuals greater power over their personal information. Both regulate organizations that collect and use data in a variety of ways.
the GDPR does have implications for businesses in the United States, despite originating in Europe. 

A brief summary of the CCPA:
1. Gives California residents increased transparency and control over how businesses collect and use their data.
Generally applies to organizations doing business in California, and to those that handle or share the personal information of California residents

A brief summary of the GDPR:
2. Gives European Union (E.U.) residents increased transparency and control over how businesses collect and use their data
Applies to organizations in and out of the E.U. that process the personal data of E.U. residents.

IEC 27001 & 27002: These are essentially an overview of everything a company must do to achieve compliance.
What is ISO 27001?
ISO 27001 is the central framework of the ISO 27000 series which is the Standard that contains the implementation requirements for an ISMS (Information Security Management System). 
(which is a series of documents relating to various parts of information security management).

What is ISO 27002?
ISO 27002 is a supplementary standard that focuses on the information security controls that organizations might choose to implement.

When you should use each standard
ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 have different objectives and will be helpful in different circumstances.
If you’re starting out with the Standard or are planning your ISMS implementation framework, then ISO 27001 is ideal. You should refer to ISO 27002 once you’ve identified the controls that you’ll be implementing to learn more about how each one works.

NERC/ NERC CIP
The NERC is the federal entity responsible for the oversight of the Bulk Electric System (BES) for North America. Its jurisdiction applies to all owners, users, producers, and suppliers of the Bulk Electric Supply in eight provinces of Canada, one state in Mexico and all of the continental United States. NERC Standards carry the force of regulation and as such are mandatory for all entities to whom it applies, and they cover a wide range of categories. 
NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards are those which apply specifically to the cybersecurity aspects of the Bulk Electric System and its efficient and reliable supply. CIP deals with the prior planning and preparation within organizations and government agencies to deal with threats to the effective and timely functioning of national and regional critical infrastructure. 

HIPAA - The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
HIPAA is United States legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. The law has emerged into greater prominence in recent years with the many health data breaches caused by cyber attacks and ransomware attacks on health insurers and providers. The federal law was signed by President Bill Clinton on Aug. 21, 1996. HIPAA overrides state laws regarding the safety of medical information, unless the state law is considered more stringent than HIPAA.
It's two main purposes are: to provide continuous health insurance coverage for workers who lose or change their job and to ultimately reduce the cost of healthcare by standardizing the electronic transmission of administrative and financial transactions. Other goals include combating abuse, fraud and waste in health insurance and healthcare delivery, and improving access to long-term care services and health insurance.
HIPAA Privacy Rule. Officially known as the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, this rule establishes national standards to protect patient health information.
HIPAA Security Rule. The Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) sets standards for patient data security.
HIPAA Enforcement Rule. This rule establishes guidelines for investigations into HIPAA compliance violations.
